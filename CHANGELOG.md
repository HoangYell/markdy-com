# Changelog

All notable changes to the `markdy` project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.7.12] — 2026-07-18

### Improved
- **System edge routing quality** — Upgraded `request` / `response` / `emit` flow rendering to obstacle-aware orthogonal/elbow routing in `@markdy/renderer-dom`, reducing line overlap with intermediate actors in dense scenes.
- **Dense-scene coverage** — Added renderer tests for 3-actor, 5-actor, and 10-actor system layouts plus fire-and-forget dashed-edge behavior verification.

## [0.7.11] — 2026-07-18

### Added
- **System actor pack foundation** — Introduced optional actor-pack registration in `@markdy/core` via `registerActorPack`, enabling external actor/action vocabularies without adding runtime dependencies to core.
- **New package: `@markdy/stdlib-systems`** — Added first-party systems pack with actor types `service`, `db`, `queue`, `client` and flow actions `request`, `response`, `emit`.
- **Flow rendering baseline** — Added DOM renderer support for system actor cards and animated request/response/emit flow edges.

### Improved
- **Parser diagnostics for larger system scenes** — Added non-fatal warnings for actor-count threshold and long actor-label overflow risk.
- **Coverage** — Added parser and renderer tests for systems pack registration and flow-action handling.

### Internal
- Added `@markdy/stdlib-systems` to workspace build/test/lint flow and release publishing pipeline.

## [0.7.10] — 2026-07-18

### Internal
- **Repository metadata normalization** — Standardized today's commit authorship metadata on active refs to a single committer identity for maintainership consistency.
- **No runtime behavior changes** — Parser, renderer, and Astro runtime behavior are unchanged from `0.7.9`.

## [0.7.9] — 2026-07-18

### Fixed
- **Robust string escaping in parser** — Hardened `@markdy/core` parsing for quoted values so scripts embedded in Markdown/MDX/JS strings are less error-prone:
  - supports both single-quoted and double-quoted string literals
  - correctly handles escaped quotes (`\"`, `\'`) while parsing comments and comma-delimited params
  - supports common escapes (`\\`, `\n`, `\r`, `\t`)
  - preserves unknown escape sequences instead of silently dropping backslashes
- **Regression coverage** — Added parser tests for escaped quotes, commas/hash inside strings, backslash-heavy paths, single-quoted literals, and unknown-escape preservation.

### Docs
- Updated [AGENT.md](docs/AGENT.md) and [SYNTAX.md](docs/SYNTAX.md) to reflect the expanded string-literal and escaping behavior.

## [0.7.8] — 2026-07-18

### Internal
- **Dependency refresh (July 2026)** — Consolidated and applied the open Dependabot updates across the monorepo:
  - `astro` to `^7.1.1` in `website` and `packages/astro` dev dependencies.
  - `@astrojs/sitemap` to `^3.7.3`.
  - `@codemirror/autocomplete` to `^6.20.3`.
  - `wrangler` to `^4.112.0`.
  - `lighthouse` to `^13.4.0`.
  - `tsx` to `^4.23.1` (root and `packages/compat`).
  - `@types/node` to `^25.9.5` in `packages/compat`.
- **CI maintenance** — Updated `actions/checkout` to `v7` in CI and release workflows.
- Regenerated `pnpm-lock.yaml` after dependency updates.

## [0.7.7] — 2026-07-18

### Changed
- **Clearer product positioning** — Updated core messaging across the repository and website to describe Markdy as a **text-to-motion animation DSL** and explicitly clarify that it is not a static diagram generator.
- **Landing page copy refresh** — Updated homepage title, hero, footer tagline, and SEO metadata to reduce Mermaid-style diagram confusion and set expectations earlier.
- **Package discoverability** — Replaced the `mermaid-alternative` keyword with `text-to-motion` in root and `@markdy/core` package metadata.

### Community
- **Discussions path fixed** — Enabled GitHub Discussions and updated issue template guidance to route usage questions to Discussions Q&A.
- **Issue follow-up** — Replied on issue #33 with clarification and the new Discussions link.

### Internal
- **Release template wording** — Updated GitHub release workflow body copy to match the new text-to-motion positioning.

## [0.7.6] — 2026-05-26

### Internal
- **Dependency bundle (May 2026)** — Consolidated 9 stale dependabot PRs into a single bundle (#22) and regenerated the workspace lockfile. No runtime changes to the published packages. Notable bumps: `jsdom` 26.1.0 → 29.1.1 (renderer-dom devDep, 3 major versions, all 14 renderer-dom tests still pass), `vitest` 4.1.4 → 4.1.7, `astro` 6.1.5 → 6.2.1, `@codemirror/view` 6.41.0 → 6.43.0, `@codemirror/search` 6.6.0 → 6.7.0, `@lezer/lr` 1.4.8 → 1.4.10, `wrangler` 4.81.1 → 4.94.0, `lighthouse` 13.1.0 → 13.2.0.
- **CI** — Updated `softprops/action-gh-release` from v2 to v3 in the release workflow (#8).

## [0.7.5] — 2026-05-16

### Fixed
- **Rocket Loader autoplay backup trigger** — Added a true belt-and-suspenders rescue path in `@markdy/astro`: an `<img onerror>` inline event handler that re-injects every type-mangled module script as a fresh `type="module"` script with `data-cfasync="false"`. Inline event handlers are never rewritten by Rocket Loader, so this still fires when the primary `<script data-cfasync="false">` rescue gets rewritten and never executes. The handler is intentionally minimal — it only handles the common case (A) where Rocket Loader mangles `type="module"` — but that is enough to bootstrap Markdy hydration even when Cloudflare ignores the cfasync opt-out for the inline rescue script. Fixes the autoplay regression on heavily-Rocket-Loader-processed pages such as `/vi/five-days-five-years-apple-m5-kernel-exploit/`.

### Internal
- Inline rescue script now builds the comment- and script-tag-closing regex patterns from string parts using `\x3c`/`\x3e` escapes, so the literal HTML tokens `<!--`, `-->`, and `</script>` no longer appear in the source. This prevents Astro's JSX parser and the HTML parser from misinterpreting the regex literals.

## [0.7.4] — 2026-05-16

### Fixed
- **Cloudflare Rocket Loader autoplay** — The `@markdy/astro` rescue script now opts out of Rocket Loader via `data-cfasync="false"` and re-injects rescued module scripts with the same opt-out. This keeps Markdy hydration executable on Rocket Loader pages where inline rescue scripts were being rewritten to a custom `*-text/javascript` type, fixing autoplay on Vietnamese article pages such as `/vi/five-days-five-years-apple-m5-kernel-exploit/`.

## [0.7.3] — 2026-05-04

### Fixed
- **Rocket Loader commented-out scripts** — Cloudflare Rocket Loader sometimes wraps `<script type="module" src="...">` in an HTML comment (`<!--<script ...></script>-->`) instead of just mangling the `type` attribute. The existing rescue logic only queried the live DOM for `script[type$="-module"][src]`, which is invisible when the tag is inside a comment. The rescue script in `@markdy/astro` now also parses `document.documentElement.innerHTML` as a raw string to find and re-inject commented-out module scripts, fixing both autoplay and click-to-play on sites with Rocket Loader enabled.

## [0.7.2] — 2026-05-04

### Fixed
- **Play button support** — Explicitly clicking the `▶ markdy` placeholder in `@markdy/astro` will now force the animation to play, overriding an `autoplay=false` dataset value.
- **Interactive viewport** — Added a click listener to the `viewport` in `@markdy/renderer-dom` to let users easily toggle play/pause on the animation. If the animation has already ended, clicking it will seamlessly restart it from the beginning.

## [0.7.1] — 2026-05-04

### Fixed
- **Click-to-play placeholder** — The `▶ markdy` SSR placeholder in `@markdy/astro` is now clickable. Clicking it immediately hydrates and starts the animation without waiting for the `IntersectionObserver` callback. `cursor: pointer` is also set on the placeholder to signal interactivity.
- **Autoplay on first navigation** — Autoplay no longer requires a full page refresh (F5) when arriving from an external link. `IntersectionObserver` threshold lowered from `1.0` to `0.25`, and `initAll()` now proactively hydrates any `.markdy-root` element that is already inside the viewport at page-load time via `getBoundingClientRect()`, bypassing the observer entirely for those elements.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-04-20

### Added
- **Chapters** (`scene "title" { ... }`) — Support for named blocks of events on a unified timeline.
- **Relative Timing Shorthand** (`@+N:`) — Introduced `@+0.3:` to specify offsets relative to the end of the previous event.
- **Camera Dynamics** — Added `camera` primitives like `camera.pan()`, `camera.zoom()`, and `camera.shake()` for cinematic control.
- **Caption Actor** — Added `caption` actor type with `at top/bottom` positioning keywords.
- **Unified Modifiers** — New comma-separated modifier syntax: `with scale=1.5, rotate=45`.
- **Mandatory Actions** — Added `!action()` prefix for "must-understand" actions that error on older parsers.
- **Exit Action** — Added `exit` action to complement `enter`, sliding actors off-screen.
- **Presets & Expansion** — Support for `preset <name>` expansion at parse-time.

### Improved
- **Parser Robustness** — Added soft-warnings for unknown tokens instead of hard errors.
- **Type Checking** — Initial parse-time type checking for figure-specific actions (`jump`, `wave`, `pose`, etc.).
- **Documentation** — Updated `PLAN.md` and `RESEARCH.md` for v2 foundation.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Expressive Character Actions** — Introduced high-level gesture and movement actions for `figure` actors in `@markdy/renderer-dom`. These simplify animation logic by replacing complex part rotation chains:
    - `jump(height, dur)`: Natural jumping motion with squash and stretch.
    - `bounce(intensity, count, dur)`: Diminishing vertical bounce effect.
    - `wave(side, dur)`: Context-aware waving gesture (oscillates specified arm).
    - `nod(dur)`: Intuitive head-nodding gesture.
    - `pose({ arms, legs, ... }, dur)`: Set multiple body part rotations simultaneously in a single command.
- **Layering Support** — Added `z` modifier to actors, allowing explicit control over rendering order (z-index) within a scene.
- **Theme-Aware Playground** — The website playground now automatically adapts scene background colors when switching between Light and Dark modes.

### Fixed
- **UI Contrast** — Adjusted `text-muted` color variables on the website for improved accessibility and readability in both themes.
- Updated documentation and playground examples to showcase new gestures and layering capabilities.

## [0.5.8] — 2026-04-12


### Fixed
- **Backslash-escaped variable interpolation** — `\${varname}` (the form produced by `String.raw` template literals in MDX) is now correctly resolved by the parser. Previously, only `${varname}` was matched, causing scenes embedded in MDX via `<Markdy code={String.raw\`...\`} />` to silently fail when using `var`, `def`, or `seq` features. The fix applies to all interpolation paths: var declarations, actor args/positions, event params, scene properties, def body templates, and seq body params.
- Added 10 new regression tests covering backslash-escaped vars across every parser code path.

## [0.5.7] — 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- **Dark mode text contrast** — `text` actors and speech bubbles no longer inherit the page's dark-mode body color when rendered inside a light-background scene.
- Speech bubbles now explicitly set `color: "#222"` so text is always readable against the white bubble background regardless of OS/browser theme.
- Added `bgToTextColor()` helper in `@markdy/renderer-dom`: computes perceived luminance (ITU-R BT.601) from the scene `bg` color and sets a contrasting `color` on the scene root element. `text` actors inherit this automatically — `#1a1a1a` on light scenes, `#f0f0f0` on dark scenes.

## [0.5.6] — 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- Extracted `totalDurationMs` as a single constant in `createPlayer` — eliminates three redundant `(ast.meta.duration ?? 0) * 1000` recalculations per frame in the rAF tick loop.

### Changed
- Release script now also bumps the root `package.json` version alongside package versions.

### Website
- Added `theme-color` meta tags for light (`#fafafa`) and dark (`#0f172a`) color schemes to improve browser chrome theming on mobile.

## [0.5.5] — 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- Version sync and lockfile update across all packages (`@markdy/core`, `@markdy/renderer-dom`, `@markdy/astro`).

## [0.5.4] — 2026-04-12

### Added
- `progressBar` option (`boolean`, default `true`) — renders a rainbow `conic-gradient` border that traces top→right→bottom→left as playback progresses.
- `copyright` option (`boolean`, default `true`) — renders a small "Powered by Markdy" link below the animation viewport.

### Fixed
- Compute the progress bar start angle from the scene aspect ratio so it visually starts at the top-left corner for non-square viewports.
- Place the copyright badge outside the scene container so it is not clipped by `overflow:hidden`.

### Docs
- Updated API tables and integration examples in README and package READMEs to document `copyright`, `progressBar`, and `loop`.

## [0.5.3] — 2026-04-12

### Added
- `copyright` option (`boolean`, default `true`) — renders a small "Powered by Markdy" link below the animation viewport, linking to markdy.com.
- `progressBar` option (`boolean`, default `true`) — renders a rainbow `conic-gradient` border that traces top→right→bottom→left as playback progresses.
- Both options are available in `createPlayer()` (`@markdy/renderer-dom`) and the `<Markdy />` Astro component.

### Fixed
- Copyright badge is now placed outside the container element to avoid `overflow:hidden` clipping.
- Rainbow progress bar starts from the top-left corner (315°).

### Docs
- Updated API tables in root README, `@markdy/renderer-dom` README, and `@markdy/astro` README to document `copyright`, `progressBar`, and `loop` options.
